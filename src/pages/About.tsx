              <p>
                Deep Investment was founded in 2003 in Bharuch, Gujarat, with a simple yet powerful mission: 
                to help families and businesses build, protect, and transfer wealth across generations. What 
                started as a local financial planning practice has grown into a trusted wealth management firm 
                serving clients across India.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our journey began when our founder, Rajesh Patel, recognized the gap between complex financial 
                products and the real needs of Indian families. He envisioned a firm that would combine 
                international best practices with deep understanding of Indian financial markets and family values.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we are proud to be SEBI registered, AMFI certified, and led by Certified Financial 
                Planners who bring more than two decades of combined experience. Our commitment to trust, 
                empathy, and long-term relationships has helped us guide over â‚¹100 crores in family wealth 
                and create more than 1,500 systematic investment plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                From our offices in Bharuch and Surat, we serve clients across India through personalized 
                consultations, comprehensive financial planning, and ongoing portfolio management. Every 
                recommendation we make is backed by thorough research and tailored to your unique circumstances.
